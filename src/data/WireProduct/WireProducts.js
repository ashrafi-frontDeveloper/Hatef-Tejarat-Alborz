    {id: 1, title: 'Iron wire', intro: 'the wires produced by Hatef Tejarat Alborz Company are categorized into four types: iron, annealed, galvanized and ribbed. The initial rebar is converted into desired size through a drawing process and is packaged into coils with the requested weight. The chemical analysis of the drawn wire is exactly the same as the initial rebar, but the mechanical properties vary based on the amount of drawing and the percentage of cross-sectional area reduction. In the table, the sizes and weights with higher demands are shown', img: '/images/categories/wire/Iron wire/5922741763993356038.jpg'},
    {id: 2, title: 'Annealed Wire', intro: 'Annealed wire, also known as black wire, is produced from steel wire after the drawing process and placement in an annealing furnace. Due to its dark surface, it is referred to as black wire. ', img: '/public/images/categories/wire/Annealed Wire/5922741763993356037.jpg'},
    {id: 3, title: 'Galvanized wire', intro: 'Galvanized wire is a type of steel wire coated with a layer of zinc to resist rust and corrosion. It is produced in two types: hot-dip galvanized and electro-galvanized. The hot-dip galvanizing process involves immersing the cleaned wire in a bath of molten zinc with a small percentage of aluminum, which creates a durable coating against rust.', img: '/images/categories/wire/Galvanized wire/5922741763993356036.jpg'},
    {id: 4, title: 'Galvanized Wire with PVC Coating', intro: 'This type of wire, in addition to its zinc coating, is covered with a layer of polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The PVC coating provides high resistance to acids and alkaline substances. In environments with high moisture or significant corrosion, the PVC polymer coating is applied over the galvanized wire to maximize corrosion resistance.', img: '/images/categories/wire/Galvanized Wire with PVC Coating/5922741763993356035.jpg'},
    {id: 5, title: 'Ribbed wire', intro: 'The ribbed wire is a new product from this manufacturing unit and is widely used across various industries. This product features unique physical characteristics such as lightweight while providing sufficient strength for structures, weldability through different methods, and a thinner thickness compared to steel rebar, making it an excellent choice, especially in the construction industry.', img: '/images/categories/wire/Ribbed wire/5922741763993356033.jpg'},
    {id: 6, title: 'Hexagonal wire mesh', intro: 'hexagonal wire mesh is a metal fence with hexagonal holes, woven from galvanized wires. Two sides of these hexagonal holes are connected to other holes with six twists. Due to its strong structure, flexibility and high resistance to corrosion, this product is widely used in various industrial and agricultural projects.', img: '/images/categories/wire/Hexagonal wire mesh/5922741763993356032.jpg'},
    {id: 7, title: 'Gabion', intro: 'Gabion is a metal mesh structure filled with stones, gravel, or other materials and is used as retaining structures, retaining walls, soil erosion control, and even for decorative purposes', img: '/images/categories/wire/Gabion/5922741763993356031.jpg'},
    {id: 8, title: 'Chicken wire mesh', intro: 'Chicken wire mesh is a steel fence with hexagonal holes made from thin galvanized wires. Due to its lightweight, high resistance to rust, corrosion and durability, it is used in various industries such as agriculture, construction, and animal care.', img: '/images/categories/wire/Chicken wire mesh/5922741763993356028.jpg'},
    {id: 9, title: 'Barbed wire', intro: 'This product is made from four strands of galvanized wire. Two of the strands are twisted together, while the other two are formed into barbs and applied along the twisted wire. This type of barbed wire features needle-like barbs, all made from galvanized wire', img: '/images/categories/wire/Barbed wire/5922741763993356029.jpg'}
